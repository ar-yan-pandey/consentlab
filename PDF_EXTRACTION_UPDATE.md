# PDF Text Extraction Update

## ‚úÖ Issue Fixed

### Problem
- Gemini AI was throwing errors when trying to extract text from images
- Error: `[400] Provided image is not valid`
- The image-based OCR approach was unreliable

### Solution
- **Removed:** Gemini AI for OCR/image text extraction
- **Added:** Direct PDF text extraction using `pdfjs-dist` library
- **Result:** Faster, more reliable, and accurate text extraction

---

## üîß Changes Made

### 1. **Added PDF.js Library**
```json
"pdfjs-dist": "^3.11.174"
```

### 2. **Created PDF Extractor Utility**
**File:** `lib/pdfExtractor.ts`
- Extracts text directly from PDF files
- Works client-side in the browser
- Processes all pages of the PDF
- Returns clean, readable text

### 3. **Updated Upload Consent Component**
**File:** `components/patient/UploadConsent.tsx`
- Now accepts **PDF files only** (no more images)
- Uses `extractTextFromPDF()` instead of `extractTextFromImage()`
- Validates that extracted text is not empty
- Still uses Gemini AI for summarization and analysis (not OCR)

### 4. **Updated Add Patient Modal**
**File:** `components/hospital/AddPatientModal.tsx`
- Patient report upload now accepts **PDF files only**
- Direct PDF text extraction for patient details
- Gemini AI only used for parsing/structuring the extracted text
- More reliable patient data extraction

## üìã How It Works Now

### Patient Portal - Upload Consent
1. User uploads a **PDF consent form**
2. PDF.js extracts text directly from the PDF
3. Gemini AI summarizes and analyzes the text
4. User sees the analyzed consent with risk assessment

### Hospital Portal - Add Patient via Report
1. Click "Upload Report" tab
2. Drop a **PDF patient report**
3. PDF.js extracts all text from the report
4. Gemini AI parses the text to extract:
   - Patient name
   - Age
   - Gender
   - Disease
   - Treatment course
   - Notes
5. Form auto-fills with extracted data

## üéØ Benefits

### ‚úÖ More Reliable
- No more "invalid image" errors
- PDF text extraction is deterministic
- Works with any text-based PDF

### ‚úÖ Faster
- Direct text extraction is faster than OCR
- No need to process images

### ‚úÖ Better Accuracy
- PDF text is extracted exactly as written
- No OCR recognition errors
- Preserves formatting and structure

### ‚úÖ Cleaner Separation
- **PDF.js:** Text extraction only
- **Gemini AI:** Summarization, analysis, and parsing only
- Each tool does what it's best at

## üöÄ Usage

### For Patients
1. Go to "Upload a Consent Form"
2. Drop or select a **PDF file**
3. Click "Analyze Consent"
4. View AI-powered analysis

### For Hospitals
1. Click "Add Patient"
2. Select "Upload Report" tab
3. Drop a **PDF patient report**
4. AI extracts details automatically
5. Review and submit

## üìù Technical Details

### PDF.js Configuration
```typescript
// Worker is loaded from CDN
pdfjsLib.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = 
  `//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pdf.js/${pdfjsLib.version}/pdf.worker.min.js`;
```

### Text Extraction Process
```typescript
1. Convert File to ArrayBuffer
2. Load PDF document
3. Loop through all pages
4. Extract text content from each page
5. Combine all text with line breaks
6. Return clean text
```

### Error Handling
- Validates PDF can be read
- Checks if text was extracted
- Shows user-friendly error messages via toast notifications
- Falls back gracefully if extraction fails

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### PDF Requirements
- Must be **text-based PDFs** (not scanned images)
- If PDF is a scanned image, text extraction will fail
- For scanned PDFs, OCR would still be needed (future enhancement)

### File Type Restrictions
- **Before:** PDF, JPG, PNG supported
- **Now:** PDF files only
- This is intentional for reliability

### Gemini AI Usage
- **No longer used for:** Image OCR, text extraction
- **Still used for:** 
  - Text summarization
  - Risk assessment
  - Language translation
  - Chatbot responses
  - Parsing structured data from text

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Could not extract text from PDF"
**Cause:** PDF is likely a scanned image, not text-based
**Solution:** Use a text-based PDF or convert scanned PDF to text first

### PDF.js worker errors
**Cause:** CDN might be blocked or slow
**Solution:** Worker loads from CDN automatically, check network connection

---

## ‚ú® Next Steps

### Optional Enhancements
1. Add support for scanned PDFs using Tesseract.js OCR
2. Show PDF preview before extraction
3. Add progress indicator for large PDFs
4. Support multi-file upload

**All PDF extraction is now working reliably!** üéâ

No more Gemini AI image errors. Direct PDF text extraction is fast and accurate.
